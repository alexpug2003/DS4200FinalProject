        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>Through this project, we aimed to analyze the prevalence and risk factors associated with Alzheimer’s Disease across North America using an interactive and data-driven approach. Here are our final takeaways:</p>

        <h3>1. Age and Genetics Are Strong Predictors</h3>
        <p>Our visualizations confirm that the risk of being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s increases significantly with age, particularly after the age of 70. Additionally, individuals carrying the APOE-ε4 allele exhibit notably higher diagnosis rates, validating the importance of genetic screening.</p>

        <h3>2. Country-Level Differences Suggest Public Health Gaps</h3>
        <p>Diagnosis rates and the prevalence of risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension varied significantly between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. This could reflect differences in healthcare access, education, and early screening initiatives, and highlights a need for country-specific health strategies.</p>

        <h3>3. Family History Is a Major Yet Underrepresented Factor</h3>
        <p>Despite being one of the most significant risk factors, family history of Alzheimer’s is not always part of routine assessments. Our data shows that individuals with a family history of Alzheimer’s have a dramatically higher likelihood of diagnosis, indicating a critical gap in early detection practices.</p>

        <h3>Suggestions for Future Work</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporate longitudinal data to assess how risk factors evolve over time and influence outcomes.</li>
            <li>Expand the analysis to include environmental, economic, and education-level variables with finer granularity.</li>
            <li>Explore clustering and predictive modeling to identify high-risk subpopulations and support early intervention strategies.</li>
        </ul>
